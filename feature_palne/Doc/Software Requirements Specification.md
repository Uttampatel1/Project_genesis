**1.5. Overview**
This SRS is organized to first provide a general overview (Section 2), then delve into the specific requirements by detailing the structure and content of each module/directory (Section 3). Section 4 covers interfaces, and Section 5 addresses non-functional requirements. The primary focus of Section 3 is to map the planned file structure to specific classes, functions, and responsibilities.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1. Product Perspective**
This is a standalone simulation framework. It is intended for research, educational purposes, or as a base for more complex simulations or games. It interacts primarily through configuration files for setup, log files/databases for data output, and potentially a graphical or web interface for real-time visualization.

**2.2. Product Functions (High Level)**
*   Simulate a 2D environment with resources and hazards.
*   Simulate multiple autonomous agents making decisions based on needs and environment.
*   Allow agents to perceive, navigate, and interact with the environment and each other.
*   Implement systems for resource gathering, crafting, and tool use.
*   Model learning, skill acquisition, and knowledge discovery (invention).
*   Facilitate basic social interactions (communication, trading, cooperation, reputation).
*   Provide mechanisms for saving, loading, and logging simulation state and events.
*   Offer options for visualizing the simulation state.

**2.3. User Characteristics (Developers/Researchers)**
The primary users are developers extending the simulation or researchers using it to study emergent behavior. Users are expected to be familiar with Python programming and potentially relevant AI/simulation concepts.

**2.4. Constraints**
*   **Primary Language:** Python 3.x.
*   **Performance:** Python's GIL may limit real-time performance with large numbers of complex agents. Optimization techniques (NumPy, Numba/Cython, careful algorithms) will be necessary.
*   **Visualization:** Chosen visualization library (Pygame, Arcade, etc.) will impose its own constraints and dependencies. Headless mode avoids this.
*   **Complexity:** The interaction of multiple complex systems (AI, social, crafting, learning) can lead to unpredictable emergent behavior, which is a goal but also a debugging challenge.

**2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies**
*   A working Python 3 environment is available.
*   Required libraries (NumPy, chosen visualization lib, AI libs, etc.) can be installed via `pip`.
*   The simulation primarily targets desktop environments (unless a web interface is chosen).
*   The grid-based world representation is sufficient for the simulation goals.

**4.1. User Interface (Optional, Visualization Dependent)**
*   If graphical (Pygame/Arcade): Shall display the world grid, agents, resources. Shall provide visual indicators for agent status (needs, current action). May allow panning/zooming. May display simulation time, speed controls, basic charts.
*   If Web (Flask/JS): A web interface shall display the simulation state. An API (RESTful JSON) provided by Flask/Django shall allow the frontend to query world/agent state periodically. Controls (pause, speed) may be provided via API calls.
*   If Headless: No graphical UI. Interaction via command-line arguments and output via log files.

**4.2. Configuration File Interfaces**
*   The simulation shall load parameters from files located in the `config/` directory.
*   The format shall be YAML or JSON as specified in Section 3.1.
*   The structure of each configuration file shall adhere to the definitions in Section 3.1. Errors during loading due to missing files or incorrect formats shall be reported clearly.

**4.3. Data Output Interfaces (Logs, Saves)**
*   **Logs:**
    *   General logs (`simulation.log`) shall be plain text.
    *   Event logs (`events.jsonl`) shall use the JSON Lines format, with each line being a valid JSON object containing at least `timestamp`, `event_type`, and relevant event data.
    *   Statistical logs (`population_stats.csv`) shall be in CSV format with a clear header row.
*   **Saves:**
    *   The save/load mechanism shall reliably store and restore the complete simulation state, including grid, resources, all agent properties (needs, inventory, skills, memory, AI state), and global time.
    *   The chosen format (pickle, JSON, DB) shall be used consistently. If not using pickle, clear serialization/deserialization logic must be defined for all relevant classes.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

**5.1. Performance**
*   **Headless:** The simulation should prioritize computational speed. Optimization techniques (NumPy vectorization, Numba/Cython for bottlenecks like AI calculations or mass updates) shall be employed as needed to support a target number of agents (e.g., hundreds or thousands depending on complexity). Profiling (`cProfile`) shall be used to identify bottlenecks.
*   **Real-time Visualization:** The simulation loop and rendering should maintain a reasonable frame rate (e.g., 15-30 FPS) for moderate agent counts (e.g., tens to low hundreds) on target hardware. Rendering should not significantly block simulation updates.
*   **Memory Usage:** Memory usage per agent should be minimized. Data structures should be chosen carefully (e.g., avoid excessive object creation in inner loops).

**5.2. Modularity & Maintainability**
*   The codebase shall be organized into logical modules/packages as described in Section 3.
*   Coupling between modules shall be minimized. Components should interact through well-defined interfaces (e.g., `Agent.update`, `Renderer.render`).
*   Code shall adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines. Docstrings and comments shall be used to explain complex logic.

**5.3. Extensibility**
*   Adding new agent actions, item types, crafting recipes, skills, or AI behaviors should require modifications primarily within the relevant modules (`simulation/actions/`, `config/`, `simulation/ai/`, etc.) with minimal changes to the core simulation loop or unrelated components.
*   The AI system should allow swapping between different implementations (Utility, FSM, BT) via configuration or command-line arguments.

**5.4. Data Persistence**
*   The system shall provide a mechanism to save the current state of the simulation to a file.
*   The system shall provide a mechanism to load a previously saved simulation state from a file, resuming execution from that point.

**5.5. Data Logging & Analyzability**
*   The system shall log key simulation events and periodic statistics in structured formats (JSONL, CSV) suitable for automated analysis using external scripts (e.g., Python with Pandas).
*   Log formats shall be consistent and well-documented.

**5.6. Reliability**
*   The simulation should handle expected errors gracefully (e.g., invalid configuration, file I/O errors).
*   Saved states should be loadable without corruption (barring changes in code structure if using pickle).
