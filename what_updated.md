With these changes, agents should now:
*   Gather wood and stone when needed (e.g., for crafting or simple stockpiling).
*   Store gathered resources in their inventory.
*   Craft a `CrudeAxe` if they have 2 Wood and 1 Stone.
*   Use the `CrudeAxe` to gather wood faster.
*   Improve their `GatherWood`, `GatherStone`, and `BasicCrafting` skills through use.
*   Remember resource locations they've visited.
*   Prioritize known resource locations before searching the world.
*   Display their inventory and skills in the UI panel.
