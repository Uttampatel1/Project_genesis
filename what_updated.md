This comprehensive update integrates the requested features. Remember:

1.  **Balance:** The specific numbers in `config.py` (decay rates, action costs, utility weights, skill gains) will likely need significant tuning based on observed simulation behavior.
2.  **Complexity:** The interactions (especially pathfinding with dynamic obstacles, social decisions) are becoming complex. Debugging emergent behavior will be challenging. Add more logging if needed.
3.  **Performance:** With more agents and complex decisions, performance might become an issue. Profiling (`cProfile`) might be necessary later.
4.  **Saving/Loading:** Agent state saving/loading is *not* implemented yet, only the world state. This is a significant step for Phase 5.
5.  **Further Expansion:** This forms a solid base for Phase 5 features like reproduction, environmental changes, more sophisticated AI, etc.
